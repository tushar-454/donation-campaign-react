# Project Name: **_Donation Campaign_**

## Discription:

This is a simple donation website. Users can donate on-site in different categories. Here I am trying to show at least three features on this site.

#### Main features:

- Users can search by category name {serarch not case sensitive}
- Users can donate and see where he/she donate, by list in the donation route.
- Users can also see in the pie chart how percentage he/she donate in total donations on the statistics route.

#### Other features:

- If users try to search without input any category name then see a nice info message
- When user search any category when he/she clear the search box then show all category item automatically.
- Users can clear search box on click the `X` icon. which see on the search box right side.
- Users can view category item details by clicking anywhere on the item
- Category item view page user can see donate button, users can donate just click here and see nice success donation message.
- If users can try multiple time donate on same category item then see nice error message.
- In donation route users can see total donation on top and also see all donation category item by list.
- Users can delete all donations item by clicking on top `clear all donatin` button.
- If Users donate many category then he/she see 4 items and see all button, when click see all button users can see all donations item already he/she donated.
